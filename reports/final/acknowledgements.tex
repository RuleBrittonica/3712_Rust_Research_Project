\section*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Professor Alex Potanin for his continued guidance, patience, and encouragement throughout this project. Thank you for putting up with my frequent disappearances due to Army commitments, for constantly pushing me to broaden the scope of my work, and for inspiring me to present my research on verification at SPLASH 2025 in Singapore.

I am also deeply grateful to Mr Sasha Pak, who has gone above and beyond despite the demands of his own PhD. His insights into the algorithms, meticulous reviews of my code and concepts, and his ability to spot subtle bugs and edge cases have been invaluable. I especially appreciate his support over the past few months, including presenting my work at SPLASH on my behalf. This project would not have come anywhere close to its current depth and polish without his help.

I would like to thank my good friends and roommates, Lachlan and Ryan, for allowing me to bounce ideas and plans off of them even when they had absolutely no idea what I was talking about, not just talking to myself is probably the only thing that has kept me sane through all of this. 

Finally I would like to thank my mother, Alison for her many hours of assistance with editing and rewriting this report, without her efforts I am sure that many sections of this report would be nigh on unreadable.
