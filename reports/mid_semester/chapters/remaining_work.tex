\section{Timeline for Future Work}

The following is a rough timeline for the remaining work on the project. It is
subject to change depending on how much work Solar Car takes up over the summer
period, and the features we decide to implement beyond \textit{generics} and
\textit{async}.

        \hline
        \textbf{Month} & \textbf{Tasks} \\ \hline
        \textbf{October} &
        Continue with detailed research into refactoring. Write the mid-semester
            report. \\ \hline
        \textbf{November} &
        Finish draft of the lit review. Continue in-depth research on generics and async for REM. \\ \hline
        \textbf{December} &
        Work with Alex to develop algorithm for Generics. Begin initial
        coding/experimentation on REM updates. Break over Christmas during
        university shutdown. \\ \hline
        \textbf{January} &
        Revise lit review. Develop algorithm for Async. Continue implementing
        key features. Write tests for initial changes, and verify. \\ \hline
        \textbf{February} &
        Finalize lit review. Scrape github / opensource projects for examples
        similar to \cite{BorrowingWithoutSorrowing}. Meet with Ilya to verify
        algorithms. \\ \hline
        \textbf{March} &
        Work through bulk of coding before university work starts to ramp up.
        Integrate features and gather data. At this stage, the projects
        implementation should be mostly finished. Start on final report writing. \\
        \hline
        \textbf{April} &
        Complete core implementation and testing. Write the bulk of the report.
        Decide on VSCode implementation or RA pull request, and complete.\\ \hline
        \textbf{May} &
        Finalize coding and testing. Complete a bulk data analysis to verify the
        work. Complete and proofread the final report. Submit final report to Ilya for feedback. \\ \hline
        \textbf{June} &
        Create the seminar presentation. Submit final report and present the seminar. \\ \hline
