\subsection*{Modifications to REM}

The most important modification to the original toolchain has been decoupling it
from the rust compiler. Previously, REM was heavily tied to rustc, the rust
compiler. It relied compiler specific representations of files and their syntax
trees. Because of this dependency, REM required a very specific buildchain, and
could not be used outside of this build context. Additionally, when I took over
the project, changes to external libraries meant that the toolchain was
completely non-functional. \\
Another small modification has been changing the way REM handles data.
Previously, the three main components of REM (controller, borrower and repairer)
worked by each reading and writing to a file, and then passing the file to the
next stage of the toolchain. By changing the way data is passed between the (now
5) modules of REM, a roughly 10-20\% speedup has been achieved.
