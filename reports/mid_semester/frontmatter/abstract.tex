\Abstract{This report details my current progress on advancing extract method
refactoring in the \href{https://www.rust-lang.org}{Rust} programming language.
This project builds on existing work completed by Ilya Sergey, Sewen Thy and
others in
\href{https://ilyasergey.net/assets/pdf/papers/rem-oopsla23.pdf}{Adventure of a
Lifetime: Extract Method Refactoring for Rust}. The first half of the project is
focussed on bringing the Rusty Extraction Maestro (REM) tool to a usable state,
with the second half focussed on researching evaluating and implementing new
extraction methods and techniques.}
