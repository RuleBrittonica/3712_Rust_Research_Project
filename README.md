# ENGN3712 (Rust Research Project with Alex Potanin and Ilya Sergey). Bringing extract method refactoring to the rust programming language.

This repository contains both of the reports for the project, as well as the
code that was written for the project (through the submodules).

## Structure

This repository contains the following directories:

 - artefacts: Contains the artefacts linked to this project. Concrete, runnable
   examples of the code that was written for the project.
 - examples: Contains example uses of the code, alongside examples included in
   the reports.
 - experiments: Contains experimental code used to test concepts and ideas.
 - rem: Contains the Rust-Extraction-Maestro (REM) toolchain. This is the main
   codebase for the project.
 - reports: Contains the reports for the project (both the final report and the
   interim report).
