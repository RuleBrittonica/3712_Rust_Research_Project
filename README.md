**solar_racing_rs**

Working on Transitioning exisiting (mainly python and julia) code for ANU Solar
Racing into Rust code as an initial demonstration for Alex and Sasha. Also
because it is really slow code and needs substantial optimisation to be usable
on the race / for future iterations of the team
